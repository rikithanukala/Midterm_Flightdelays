# Flight Delays: Arrival Flights Delay analysis across United States of America (2023)

Project Description : This project explores American Airlines arrival flight delays in 2023, with an emphasis on flights arriving at various airports across United States. The main objective is to understand the trends and causes of delays and to identify patterns that could provide insights for improving on-time performance and customer satisfaction.

The dataset used for this project is "Detailed Statistics - Arrivals", which contains 117,474 records of American Airlines flights arriving at various airports across United States of America in 2023. The dataset includes fields such as Flight Number, Origin Airport, Destination Airport (CLT), Arrival Time, Scheduled Arrival Time, Arrival Delay, Date of Flight, Delay Causes (e.g., weather, air traffic control, airline operations).
This data was sourced from United States Department of Transportation - Bureau of Transportation Statistics(Detailed Statistics Arrivals). https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ontime/Arrivals.aspx

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights into the performance of American Airlines flights at CLT in 2023, focusing on arrival delays. The project addresses several key questions:
How many flights experienced delays?
What were the monthly trends in delays?
Which airports caused the highest number of delayed flights arriving at CLT?
What were the primary causes of these delays?
How does the delay performance vary across different times of the year?
By presenting this information in an interactive Tableau Story, stakeholders can easily identify periods of high delays, root causes of those delays, and opportunities for improving performance.

Key Features :

Overview of Flight Performance: Summary of total flights, percentage of delayed flights and average delay times. 
Monthly Delay Trends: A month-by-month analysis of flight delays, identifying trends and fluctuations over time.
Delay Causes Breakdown: Insights into the reasons behind flight delays, such as carrier, weather, and NAS delays.
Airport Performance: A comparison of delay performance across different airports in the United States and top 5 airports with highest delays.

Future Work :

While the current analysis provides valuable insights, there are several opportunities for future work and enhancements:
Incorporating Additional Airlines: Expanding the analysis to include other airlines operating at CLT to compare performance across the board.
Predictive Analysis: Implementing machine learning models to predict future flight delays based on historical data, weather forecasts, and air traffic patterns.
On-time Performance Comparison: Benchmarking American Airlines' performance against other major airlines flying into CLT.
Passenger Impact Analysis: Analyzing how flight delays impact passenger connections and overall travel experience (e.g., missed connections, rebooking trends).
